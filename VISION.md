## 🎯 The Problem: The Trust Crisis in AI Content

We're living through the largest information revolution in human history. AI can now generate articles, answer questions, write code, and create content indistinguishable from human work. But there's a critical problem:

**We have no systematic way to verify if AI-generated content is accurate, unbiased, or trustworthy.**

Today's reality:
- Students use AI for homework without verification
- Journalists cite AI-generated "facts" that may be hallucinated
- Doctors reference AI medical information without validation
- Researchers rely on AI literature reviews with no fact-checking
- Millions make decisions based on unverified AI content daily

**The cost of misinformation is measured in lives, careers, and trust in technology itself.**

## 💡 Our Solution: Decentralized Trust Infrastructure

**TrustGraph is building the trust layer for the AI-generated internet.**

We're not just a fact-checker. We're creating a **decentralized, automated, and verifiable trust infrastructure** that:

### 1. **Automates Verification at Scale**
- AI-powered comparison engines analyze millions of articles
- Vector embeddings detect semantic differences
- NLP identifies hallucinations, bias, and inconsistencies
- Real-time processing as content is published

### 2. **Decentralizes Trust**
- Trust annotations published to OriginTrail DKG
- Immutable, blockchain-verified provenance
- No single point of failure or censorship
- Community-driven validation

### 3. **Makes Trust Queryable**
- Every piece of AI content gets a trust score
- Developers query via API
- AI agents check before citing sources
- Browsers show trust badges automatically
